# express-firebase

Simple Firebase Admin Server using NodeJS.

You used Firebase for auth, realtime DB, and all. Finally you need your own server
to integrate with 3rd party services, or maybe custom token, or you need server-side operations.

## How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Then start the server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
